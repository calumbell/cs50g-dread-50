# Dread-50

Assignment 9 of *CS50 Introduction to Games Development* (by EDX/HarvardX) was to implement new features for a simple 3D maze exploration game that was heavily inspired by the famous VR game *Dreadhalls*. This weeks assignment was fairly light by design (to give us more time to work on our final projects), but it served as a good introduction to working with generative algorithms and scnene/data management in Unity.

## Requirements
- Unity (v 2018.4) -> https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive or via Unity Hub https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

## Topics
- Texturing
- Materials & Lighting
- 3D Maze Generation
- First-person control
- Multiple scenes
- Fog
- UI Components

## Assessment Criteria
- Spawn holes in the floor of the maze that the player can fall through.
- When the player falls through any holes, transition to a “Game Over” screen similar to the Title Screen, implemented as a separate scene.
- Add a Text label to the Play scene that keeps track of which maze they’re in, incrementing each time they progress to the next maze.
